# Gantt chart for Angular.js
A Gantt chart directive for Angular.js without any other dependencies.

####<a href="http://schweigi.github.io/angular-gantt/index.html" target="_blank">TRY THE DEMO</a>

### Features
- Usable with or without Bootstrap 3
- Every task has its own color, subject, date (from, to)
- Rows combine multiple tasks and can have independent descriptions
- Rows can be sorted by description, date and custom order
- A user can drag&drop a row to sort it in custom mode
- Events on scroll, click, add or update
- Configurable

### Missing / To improve
- Possibility for the user to update tasks (by drag&drop)
- Add support for US week numbers. Currently all week numbers are according to ISO 8106.
- Support for virtual scrolling to be able to handle many years of data.
- If new rows / tasks are added on scrolling during a fast horizontal mouse wheel scroll it is possible that the current view position is not kept.

### Usage
Copy the files [js/gantt.js](js/gantt.js), [css/gantt.css](css/gantt.css) and [template/gantt.tmpl.html](template/gantt.tmpl.html) to your project. For a sample app see the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](js/demo.js).

1. Add the [gantt.js](js/gantt.js) and [gantt.css](css/gantt.css) files to your HTML code.

        <head><link rel="stylesheet" href="css/gantt.css"/></head>
        <body><script src="js/gantt.js"></script></body>
2. Include the module `gantt` to your Angular app modules.

        var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['gantt']);
3. Put directive `gantt` into your HTML code at the position you would like to show the Gantt chart.

        <gantt></gantt>

### Attributes
- **clear-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to removes all rows and tasks at once.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](js/demo.js) to see how this callback is used.

- **first-day-of-week** (default: `1`)

  Specifies the first day of the week.
  - `0`: Sunday
  - `1`: Monday
  - `2`: Tuesday
  - `3`: Wednesday
  - `4`: Thursday
  - `5`: Friday
  - `6`: Saturday

- **from-date**

  If specified ensures that the chart is rendered starts at the from-date. This is useful for showing the chart even without any tasks or empty time before the first task.

  *Note: At this time this does not truncate the tasks, so you will have to do that to your data*

- **to-date**

  If specified ensures that the chart is rendered goes at least to the end-date. This is useful for showing the chart even without any tasks or empty time after the last task.

  *Note: At this time this does not truncate the tasks, so you will have to do that to your data*

- **data**

  Allows you to specify the data model for the gantt chart.

- **load-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to load more data to the Gantt.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](js/demo.js) to see how this callback is used. An example of the data definition can be found in [demo\_sample\_data.js](js/demo_sample_data.js).

- **on-gantt-ready**

  This event is raised when the Gantt is initialized and ready to load data.

- **on-row-added** and **on-row-updated**

  Those events are raised if a new row is added or updated. A row is updated if the custom sort order has been changed by the user.

- **on-row-clicked**

  This event is raised if the user clicks on a row. The event has a `row`, `date` and `column` property you can use to detect the date clicked (or use `event.column.fromDate`/`event.column.toDate`)

- **on-scroll**

  This event is raised if the user scrolls to the left or right side of the Gantt chart. Use this event to load more data on the fly.

- **on-task-clicked**

  This event is raised if the user clicks on a task.

- **remove-data**

  Returns a function (`fn`) which can be called to remove more data from the Gantt. It is possible to remove complete rows or specific tasks.
  Take a look at the files [demo.html](demo.html) and [demo.js](js/demo.js) to see how this callback is used.

- **sort-mode** (default: `name`)

  Sorts the rows by the given value.
  - `name`: Sort by row description
  - `date`: Sort by the earliest task `from` date of each row
  - `custom`: Custom sort order using a property called **order** on each row

- **template-url** (default: `template/gantt.tmpl.html`)

  URL of the Gantt HTML template. You need to specify this attribute if you put the template in a different folder otherwise the directive won't work.

- **view-scale** (default: `day`)

  Defines the Gantt column scale.
  - `day`: Each column is one day wide
  - `hour`: Each column is one hour wide

- **view-scale-factor** (default 2)
  How wide are the columns, 1 being 1em per unit (hour or day depending on scale). This allows you add logic like `view-scale-factor="scale == 'day' ?  5 : 2"` to have wider days than hours
- **weekend-days** (default: `[0,6]`)

  Array containing all weekend days. Assign an empty array `[]` if you don't want any weekend days at all. Example:
  - `[0,6]`: Sunday, Saturday
