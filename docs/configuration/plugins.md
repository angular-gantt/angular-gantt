# Plugins

Plugins are additional features that are not included in `angular-gantt` main distribution file.
They can be configured using attributes defined for each plugin, and some plugins may use additional properties from
[data](attributes.md#data).

Each plugin is available under `assets` folder as standalone `angular-gantt-xxxxxx.js` and `angular-gantt-xxxxxx.css`
files, where `xxxxxx` plugin is the name of the plugin.

`angular-gantt-plugins.js` and `angular-gantt-plugins.css` files contains every standard plugin as a single package. 

## Enable a plugin

1. Add the plugin module dependency to your application module dependencies list.

        angular.module('myApp', ['gantt', 'gantt.xxxxxx']);

2. Add the plugin directive as a child element of the gantt directive.

        <gantt>
            <gantt-xxxxxx></gantt-xxxxxx>
        </gantt>
